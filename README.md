# Researching the Best Place to Open a Restaurant in Edinburgh

## Leveraging Foursquare API and clustering

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is a relatively small but vibrant city with various types of restaurant, often bustling with international tourists.

This project researches the best place to open a new restaurant in the city. Anyone who wants to open a new restaurant in Edinburgh would be able to use the insights from this project.

This research uses Foursquare API to analyze the best area in Edinburgh to open a new restaurant based on surrounding venues. Clustering is also used to divide Edinburgh into different clusters, decide the characteristics of each cluster, then decide on which cluster/area is the best for the location of a new restaurant, based on the venues found in that area.

## The Data

The data used was downloaded from doogal <https://www.doogal.co.uk/PostcodeDownloads.php>, and the specific link to download the Edinburgh post codes csv file is <https://www.doogal.co.uk/UKPostcodesCSV.ashx?Search=EH>. The data has been previously downloaded and is now accessible at <https://github.com/eparamasari/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/data/EH-postcodes.csv>.

It has 50 columns, including post code, latitude and longitude coordinates, ward, rural/urban, output area, city, and country. Not all columns are necessary for the research, so initial data cleaning will be performed prior to analysis.
